## Report

- provides a description of the implementation.

- Learning Algorithm
    - The report clearly describes the learning algorithm, along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.

- Plot of Rewards
    - A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agents get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents).
    - The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

- Ideas for Future Work
    - The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
